    <h1 style="color: red">Algebra Overview</h1>
    <p>Algebra helps solve mathematical equations and allows us to derive unknown quantities, like bank interest, proportions, percentages. We can use variables in algebra to represent unknown quantities that are coupled. Some of the main topics under algebra include basics of algebra, exponents, simplification of algebraic expressions, polynomials, quadratic equations, etc. in such a way as to rewrite the equations.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red">Elementary Algebra</h2>
    <p>Elementary Algebra covers the traditional topics studied in a modern elementary algebra course. Arithmetic includes numbers along with mathematical operations like +, -, x, ÷. But in algebra, the numbers are often represented by symbols and are called variables such as x, a, n, y. It also allows the common formulation of the laws of arithmetic such as, a + b = b + a and it is the first step that shows the systematic exploration of all the properties of a system of real numbers.</p>
    <p>The concepts coming under elementary algebra include variables, evaluating expressions and equations, properties of equalities and inequalities, solving algebraic equations and linear equations having one or two variables, etc.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red">Intermediate and Advanced Algebra</h2>
    <p>This level of algebra has more complex equations to solve compared to pre-algebra. Advanced algebra includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Equations with inequalities</li>
        <li>Matrices</li>
        <li>Solving systems of linear equations</li>
        <li>Graphing of functions and linear equations</li>
        <li>Conic sections</li>
        <li>Polynomial equations</li>
        <li>Quadratic functions with inequalities</li>
        <li>Polynomials and expressions with radicals</li>
        <li>Sequences and series</li>
        <li>Rational expressions</li>
        <li>Trigonometry</li>
        <li>Discrete mathematics and probability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: red">Abstract Algebra</h2>
    <p>Abstract algebra deals with algebraic structures like fields, groups, modules, rings, lattices, vector spaces, etc. The concepts of abstract algebra are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sets</strong> – Defined as the collection of objects determined by a specific property. For example, a set of all 2×2 matrices, the set of two-dimensional vectors in the plane, and different forms of finite groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Operations</strong> – Conceptualizing addition gives us binary operations. These operations are meaningless without a set.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Element</strong> – The numbers 0 and 1 are conceptualized as identity elements for specific operations. Here, 0 is the identity element for addition, whereas 1 is the identity element for multiplication.</li>
        <li><strong>Inverse Elements</strong> – Inverse elements arise with negative numbers. For addition, “-a” is the inverse of “a” and for multiplication, the inverse is written as “a⁻¹”.</li>
        <li><strong>Associativity</strong> – This property indicates that the grouping of numbers being added does not affect the sum. For example, (3 + 2) + 4 = 3 + (2 + 4).</li>
    </ul>
