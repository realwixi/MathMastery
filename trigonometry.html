    <h1 style="color: red">Introduction to Trigonometry</h1>
    <p>Trigonometry is one of the most important branches in mathematics. The word trigonometry is formed by clubbing words 'Trigonon' and 'Metron' which means triangle and measure respectively. It is the study of the relation between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. It thus helps in finding the measure of unknown dimensions of a right-angled triangle using formulas and identities based on this relationship.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Trigonometry Basics</h2>
    <p>Trigonometry basics deal with the measurement of angles and problems related to angles. There are three basic functions in trigonometry: sine, cosine, and tangent. These three basic ratios or functions can be used to derive other important trigonometric functions: cotangent, secant, and cosecant. All the important concepts covered under trigonometry are based on these functions. Hence, further, we need to learn these functions and their respective formulas at first to understand trigonometry.</p>
    
    <p>In a right-angled triangle, we have the following three sides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Perpendicular - It is the side opposite to the angle θ.</li>
        <li>Base - This is the adjacent side to the angle θ.</li>
        <li>Hypotenuse - This is the side opposite to the right angle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: red">Trigonometric Ratios</h2>
    <p>There are six basic ratios in trigonometry that help in establishing a relationship between the ratio of sides of a right triangle with the angle. If θ is the angle in a right-angled triangle, formed between the base and hypotenuse, then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sin θ = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse</li>
        <li>cos θ = Base/Hypotenuse</li>
        <li>tan θ = Perpendicular/Base</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The value of the other three functions: cot, sec, and cosec depend on tan, cos, and sin respectively as given below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cot θ = 1/tan θ = Base/Perpendicular</li>
        <li>sec θ = 1/cos θ = Hypotenuse/Base</li>
        <li>cosec θ = 1/sin θ = Hypotenuse/Perpendicular</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: red">Important Trigonometric Angles</h2>
    <p>Trigonometric angles are the angles in a right-angled triangle using which different trigonometric functions can be represented. Some standard angles used in trigonometry are 0º, 30º, 45º, 60º, and 90º. The trigonometric values for these angles can be observed directly in a trigonometric table. Some other important angles in trigonometry are 180º, 270º, and 360º. Trigonometric angles can be expressed in terms of trigonometric ratios as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>θ = sin<sup>-1</sup> (Perpendicular/Hypotenuse)</li>
        <li>θ = cos<sup>-1</sup> (Base/Hypotenuse)</li>
        <li>θ = tan<sup>-1</sup> (Perpendicular/Base)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Trigonometric Ratio Formulas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>sin θ = Opposite Side/Hypotenuse</li>
        <li>cos θ = Adjacent Side/Hypotenuse</li>
        <li>tan θ = Opposite Side/Adjacent Side</li>
        <li>cot θ = 1/tan θ = Adjacent Side/Opposite Side</li>
        <li>sec θ = 1/cos θ = Hypotenuse/Adjacent Side</li>
        <li>cosec θ = 1/sin θ = Hypotenuse/Opposite Side</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Trigonometry Formulas Involving Pythagorean Identities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>sin²θ + cos²θ = 1</li>
        <li>tan²θ + 1 = sec²θ</li>
        <li>cot²θ + 1 = cosec²θ</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Sine and Cosine Law in Trigonometry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC</li>
        <li>c² = a² + b² – 2ab cos C</li>
        <li>a² = b² + c² – 2bc cos A</li>
        <li>b² = a² + c² – 2ac cos B</li>
    </ul>
