    <h1 style="color: red">Mathematical Logic</h1>
    <p>Logic means reasoning. The reasoning may be a legal opinion or mathematical confirmation. We apply certain logic in Mathematics. Basic Mathematical logics are negation, conjunction, and disjunction. The symbolic form of mathematical logic is, ‘~’ for negation ‘^’ for conjunction and ‘ v ‘ for disjunction. In this article, we will discuss the basic Mathematical logic with the truth table and examples.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Mathematical Logic Classification</h2>
    <p>Mathematical logic is classified into four subfields. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set Theory</li>
        <li>Model Theory</li>
        <li>Recursion Theory</li>
        <li>Proof Theory</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Basic Mathematical Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>The three logical operators used in Mathematics are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conjunction (AND)</li>
        <li>Disjunction (OR)</li>
        <li>Negation (NOT)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Mathematical Logic Formulas</h3>
    
    <h4 style="color: red">Conjunction (AND)</h4>
    <p>We can join two statements by “AND” operand. It is also known as a conjunction. Its symbolic form is “∧”. In this operator, if any one of the statements is false, then the result will be false. If both the statements are true, then the result will be true. It has two or more inputs but only one output.</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th style="color: blue">Input A</th>
            <th style="color: blue">Input B</th>
            <th style="color: blue">A AND B (A ∧ B)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>False</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4 style="color: red">Disjunction (OR)</h4>
    <p>We can join two statements by “OR” operand. It is also known as disjunction. Its symbolic form is “∨”. In this operator, if any one of the statements is true, then the result is true. If both the statements are false, then the result will be false. It has two or more inputs but only one output.</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th style="color: blue">Input A</th>
            <th style="color: blue">Input B</th>
            <th style="color: blue">A OR B (A ∨ B)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>True</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>True</td>
            <td>True</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
            <td>False</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4 style="color: red">Negation (NOT)</h4>
    <p>Negation is an operator which gives the opposite statement of the given statement. It is also known as NOT, denoted by “~”. It is an operation that gives the opposite result. If the input is true, then the output will be false. If the input is false, then the output will be true. It has one input and one output.</p>
