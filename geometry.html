    <h1 style="color: red">Geometry</h1>
    <p>Geometry is the study of different types of shapes, figures, and sizes in Maths or in real life. In geometry, we learn about different angles, transformations, and similarities in the figures. The basics of geometry depend on majorly point, line, angles, and plane. All the geometrical shapes are based on these basic geometrical concepts.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Branches of Geometry</h2>
    <p>The branches of geometry are categorized as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Algebraic geometry</li>
        <li>Discrete geometry</li>
        <li>Differential geometry</li>
        <li>Euclidean geometry</li>
        <li>Convex geometry</li>
        <li>Topology</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Plane Geometry (Two-dimensional Geometry)</h2>
    <p>Plane Geometry deals with flat shapes which can be drawn on a piece of paper. These include lines, circles & triangles of two dimensions. Plane geometry is also known as two-dimensional geometry.</p>
    <p>All the two-dimensional figures have only two measures such as length and breadth. It does not deal with the depth of the shapes. Some examples of plane figures are square, triangle, rectangle, circle, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>The important terminologies in plane geometry are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Point</li>
        <li>Line</li>
        <li>Angles</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Point</h3>
    <p>A point is a precise location or place on a plane. A dot usually represents them. It is important to understand that a point is not a thing, but a place. Also, note that a point has no dimension; preferably, it has the only position.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Line</h3>
    <p>The line is straight (no curves), having no thickness and extends in both directions without end (infinitely). It is important to note that it is the combination of infinite points together to form a line. In geometry, we have a horizontal line and vertical line which are x-axis and y-axis respectively.</p>
    <img src="line segment.jpg">
    <p><strong>Line Segment</strong> ‚Äì If a line has a starting and an endpoint then it is called a Line Segment.</p>
    <p><strong>Ray</strong> ‚Äì If a line has a starting point and has no endpoint is called Ray. Eg. Sun Rays</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Angles in Geometry</h3>
    <p>In planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.</p>
    
    <h4 style="color: red">Types of Angle</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acute Angle</strong> ‚Äì An Acute angle (or Sharp angle) is an angle smaller than a right angle ie. it can range between 0 ‚Äì 90 degrees.</li>
        <li><strong>Obtuse Angle</strong> ‚Äì An Obtuse angle is more than 90 degrees but is less than 180 degrees.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Angle</strong> ‚Äì An angle of 90 degrees.</li>
        <li><strong>Straight Angle</strong> ‚Äì An angle of 180 degrees is a straight angle, i.e. the angle formed by a straight line</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: red">Polygons in Geometry</h3>
    <p>A plane figure that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed polygonal chain or circuit.</p>
    <p>The name ‚Äòpoly‚Äô refers to multiple. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon polygon.</p>
    <p><strong>General Formula for Sum of internal Angles of a polygon ‚Äì</strong></p>
    <p>Sum of internal Angles of a polygon = (ùëõ‚àí2)√ó180</p>

        <li>Quadrilaterals</li>
        <li>Pentagon</li>
        <li>Hexagon</li>
        <li>Heptagon</li>
        <li>Octagon</li>
