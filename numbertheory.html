    <h1 style="color: red">Number Theory</h1>
    <p>Number theory is a branch of mathematics which helps to study the set of positive whole numbers, say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , which are also called the set of natural numbers and sometimes called “higher arithmetic”.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Introduction to Number Theory</h2>
    <p>In number theory, the numbers are classified into different types, such as natural numbers, whole numbers, complex numbers, and so on. The sub-classifications of the natural number are given below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Odd Numbers:</strong> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19…..</li>
        <li><strong>Even Numbers:</strong> 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Square Numbers:</strong> 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Cube Numbers:</strong> 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512 . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Prime Numbers:</strong> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61 . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Composite Numbers:</strong> 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24 . . .</li>
        <li><strong>1 (modulo 4) Numbers:</strong> 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, . . .</li>
        <li><strong>3 (modulo 4) Numbers:</strong> 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Triangular Numbers:</strong> 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Perfect Numbers:</strong> 6, 28, 496, 8128, . . .</li>
        <li><strong>Fibonacci Numbers:</strong> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 . . .</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Number Theory Topics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Even Numbers:</strong> The numbers that are evenly divided by 2 are called even numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Odd Numbers:</strong> The numbers that are not evenly divided by 2 are called odd numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Square Numbers:</strong> A number multiplied by itself is called square numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cube Numbers:</strong> A number multiplied by itself 3 times is called cube numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Prime Numbers:</strong> If a number has only two factors: 1 and the number, it is called prime numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Co Prime Numbers:</strong> Two numbers are called co prime numbers if the highest common factor between the two is 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Composite Numbers:</strong> Composite numbers have more than two factors. The composite numbers are numbers which are not prime numbers. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.</li>
        <li><strong>Modulo 4 Numbers:</strong> A number is said to be 1 (modulo 4) number if it leaves a remainder 1 when divided by 4. Similarly, if a number leaves a remainder 3 when divided by 4, it is said to be 3 (modulo 4) number.</li>
        <li><strong>Triangular Numbers:</strong> A number is said to be a triangular number when that number of pebbles can be arranged in a triangle using one pebble at the top, two pebbles in the next row, three pebbles in the next row, and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Fibonacci Numbers:</strong> Fibonacci numbers are created starting with 1 and 1, then get the next number in the list and adds the previous two numbers. Say, 1+1 =2 and then add 1+2 you get 3, then adds 2+3 gives 5, then 3+5 gives 8 and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Applications of Number Theory</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the most important number theory applications. Number theory is used to find some of the important divisibility tests, whether a given integer m divides the integer n. Number theory has countless applications in mathematics as well in practical applications such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Security systems like in banking securities</li>
        <li>E-commerce websites</li>
        <li>Coding theory</li>
        <li>Barcodes</li>
        <li>Making of modular designs</li>
        <li>Memory management system</li>
        <li>Authentication system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is also defined in hash functions, linear congruences, pseudorandom numbers, and fast arithmetic operations.</p>
