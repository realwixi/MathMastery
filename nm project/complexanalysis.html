    <h1 style="color: red">Complex Analysis</h1>
    <h2 style="color: red">Complex Numbers</h2>
    <p>A number of the form x + iy where x, y are real numbers and i<sup>2</sup> = -1 is called a complex number.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">Modulus and Argument of a Complex Number</h2>
    <p>The modulus of a complex number z = x + iy is the real number √(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) and is denoted by |z|.</p>
    <p>The argument of a complex number z = x + iy is given by: arg(z) = θ = tan<sup>-1</sup>(y/x), where x, y ≠ 0.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">Complex Functions</h2>
    <p>In complex analysis, a complex function is a function defined from complex numbers to complex numbers.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">Limits of Complex Functions</h2>
    <p>Let w = f(z) be any function of z defined in a bounded closed domain D. Then the limit of f(z) as z approaches z<sub>0</sub> is denoted by “l”.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">Continuity of Complex Functions</h2>
    <p>A complex function w = f(z) defined in the bounded closed domain D, is said to be continuous at a point Z<sub>0</sub>, if f(z<sub>0</sub>) is defined and the limit of f(z) as z approaches z<sub>0</sub> exists and is equal to f(z<sub>0</sub>).</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">Complex Differentiation</h2>
    <p>Some of the standard results of complex differentiation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>dc/dz = 0; where c is a complex constant</li>
        <li>d/dz (f ± g) = (df/dz) ± (dg/dz)</li>
        <li>d/dz [c.f(z)] = c . (df/dz)</li>
        <li>d/dz zn = nzn-1</li>
        <li>d/dz (f.g) = f (dg/dz) + g (df/dz)</li>
        <li>d/dz (f/g) = [g (df/dz) – f (dg/dz)]/ g<sup>2</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: red">Complex Integration</h2>
    <p>Suppose f(z) be a function of complex variable defined in a domain D and “c” be the closed curve in the domain D.</p>
    <p>Here, ∫<sub>c</sub> f(z) dz is known as the contour integral.</p>
