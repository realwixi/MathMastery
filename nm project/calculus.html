    <h1 style="color: red">Calculus</h1>
    <p>Calculus, a branch of Mathematics, developed by Newton and Leibniz, deals with the study of the rate of change. Calculus Math is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function. Calculus Math mainly focuses on some important topics such as differentiation, integration, limits, functions, and so on.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Branches of Calculus</h2>
    <p>Calculus Mathematics is broadly classified into two different such:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Differential Calculus</li>
        <li>Integral Calculus</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Differential Calculus Basics</h2>
    <p>Differential Calculus is concerned with the problems of finding the rate of change of a function with respect to the other variables. To get the optimal solution, derivatives are used to find the maxima and minima values of a function. Differential calculus arises from the study of the limit of a quotient. It deals with variables such as x and y, functions f(x), and the corresponding changes in the variables x and y. The symbol dy and dx are called differentials. The process of finding the derivatives is called differentiation. The derivative of a function is represented by dy/dx or f’(x). It means that the function is the derivative of y with respect to the variable x. Let us discuss some of the important topics covered in the basic differential calculus.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Limits</h3>
    <p>The degree of closeness to any value or the approaching term. A limit is normally expressed using the limit formula as:</p>
    <p>lim<sub>x→c</sub> f(x) = A</p>
    <p>It is read as “the limit of f of x as x approaches c equals A”.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Derivatives</h3>
    <p>Instantaneous rate of change of a quantity with respect to the other. The derivative of a function is represented as:</p>
    <p>lim<sub>h→0</sub> (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h = A</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Continuity</h3>
    <p>A function f(x) is said to be continuous at a particular point x = a, if the following three conditions are satisfied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>f(a) is defined</li>
        <li>lim<sub>x→a</sub> f(x) exists</li>
        <li>lim<sub>x→a<sup>-</sup></sub> f(x) = lim<sub>x→a<sup>+</sup></sub> f(x) = f(a)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Continuity and Differentiability</h3>
    <p>A function is always continuous if it is differentiable at any point, whereas the vice-versa condition is not always true.</p>

    <h3 style="color: red">Quotient Rule</h3>
    <p>The Quotient rule is a method for determining the derivative (differentiation) of a function that is in fractional form.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Chain Rule</h3>
    <p>The rule applied for finding the derivative of the composition of a function is basically known as the chain rule.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Integral Calculus Basics</h2>
    <p>Integral calculus is the study of integrals and their properties. It is mostly useful for the following two purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To calculate f from f’ (i.e., from its derivative). If a function f is differentiable in the interval of consideration, then f’ is defined in that interval.</li>
        <li>To calculate the area under a curve.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Integration</h3>
    <p>Integration is the reciprocal of differentiation. As differentiation can be understood as dividing a part into many small parts, integration can be said as a collection of small parts in order to form a whole. It is generally used for calculating areas.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Definite Integral</h3>
    <p>A definite integral has a specific boundary within which function needs to be calculated. The lower limit and upper limit of the independent variable of a function are specified; its integration is described using definite integrals. A definite integral is denoted as:</p>
    <p>∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f(x) dx = F(x)</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Indefinite Integral</h3>
    <p>An indefinite integral does not have a specific boundary, i.e., no upper and lower limit is defined. Thus, the integration value is always accompanied by a constant value (C). It is denoted as:</p>
    <p>∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C</p>
