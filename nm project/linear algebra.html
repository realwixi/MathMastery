    <h1 style="color: red">Linear Algebra Overview</h1>
    <p>Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that focuses on vectors, vector spaces (or linear spaces), linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. It is essential for understanding geometric concepts and is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and economics. Core topics in linear algebra include matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and vector spaces. This field provides tools for solving linear systems, performing transformations, and analyzing data, making it fundamental to both theoretical and applied sciences.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Key Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Vectors and Vector Spaces</h3>
    <p>Vectors are objects that have both magnitude and direction, and they can be added together and scaled by numbers (scalars). A vector space (or linear space) is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars while satisfying certain axioms (like closure, associativity, and distributivity).</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Matrices</h3>
    <p>Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that represent linear transformations and systems of linear equations. Operations on matrices include addition, multiplication, and finding the inverse.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Determinants</h3>
    <p>The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix and provides important information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible and the volume scaling factor of the transformation it represents.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h3>
    <p>Given a matrix <code>A</code>, an eigenvector is a nonzero vector <code>v</code> such that <code>Av = λv</code> for some scalar <code>λ</code> (the eigenvalue). These concepts are crucial in various applications, including stability analysis, quantum mechanics, and principal component analysis (PCA).</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Linear Transformations</h3>
    <p>These are functions that map vectors to other vectors in a way that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. They can be represented by matrices, making it possible to use matrix operations to study and apply these transformations.</p>
    
    <h3 style="color: red">Inner Product Spaces</h3>
    <p>These are vector spaces with an additional structure called the inner product, which allows the definition of lengths and angles. This structure is key in many applications, including projections and orthogonality.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: red">Applications</h2>
    <p>Linear algebra is used in numerous fields. In computer science, it's fundamental to algorithms for graphics, machine learning, and data mining. In physics, it helps model quantum states and classical mechanics. In economics, it aids in input-output models and optimization problems.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, linear algebra is a powerful mathematical framework that underpins much of modern science and engineering, providing tools for modeling, analyzing, and solving complex problems in high-dimensional spaces.</p>
